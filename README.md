# Description

The main objective of our project was to create an application that would help facilitate a user with his or her diet. The application would do this by asking the user questions about his or her age, height, current weight, activity level and goal weight and use this information to set a specific amount of daily consumable calories for the user depending on if he/she wants to lose weight, gain weight or maintain the same weight. The user would keep track of these calories by using the application’s food recognition software which allows a user to scan a food item that he or she is about to eat and then recognizes this food item along with the number of calories of a typical serving size of that food item. These calories would be subtracted from the user’s daily consumable calories and the user’s remaining calories would be displayed.

A device running Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher is required to run the demo due
to the use of the camera2 API, although the native libraries themselves can run
on API >= 14 devices.
